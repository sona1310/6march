            <h1>Delhi</h1>
            <article>
                <p>Delhi , officially the National Capital Territory (NCT) of Delhi, is a
                    city and a union territory of India containing New Delhi, <br />the
                    capital of India. Straddling the Yamuna river, but primarily its
                    western or right bank, Delhi shares borders with the state of<br />
                    Uttar Pradesh in the east and with the state of Haryana in the
                    remaining directions.
                </p><br>

                <p>Delhi is the second-wealthiest city in India (after Mumbai) and is
                   home to 18 billionaires and 23,000 millionaires.<br> Delhi ranks fifth
                   among the Indian states and union territories in human development index.
                   Delhi has the second-highest GDP per capita in India (after Goa).<br>
                 Although a union territory, the political administration of the NCT of Delhi
                 today more closely resembles that of a state of India,<br> with its own legislature,
                  high court and an executive council of ministers headed by a Chief Minister.</p><br>
                   <p>New Delhi is jointly administered by the federal government of India and the local
                    government of Delhi, and serves as the capital of the nation as well<br> as the NCT of Delhi. 
                    Delhi is also the centre of the National Capital Region, which is a <br>'interstate regional planning'
                     area created in 1985.Delhi hosted the inaugural 1951 Asian Games, 1982 Asian Games,<br>
                      1983 NAM Summit, 2010 Men's Hockey World Cup, 2010 Commonwealth Games, 2012 BRICS Summit and was<br> 
                      one of the major host cities of the 2011 Cricket World Cup.</p>

            <aside>
                <p>The ancient name of the site of<br> modern Delhi is Indraprastha,
                    which <br>literally means "Plain of Indra" <br>or "City of Indra" in Sanskrit.</p>
